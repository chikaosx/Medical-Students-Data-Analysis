## Medical Students Data - Summary Analysis
This task focus on the insightful analysis of the Medical Students Data, focusing on key parameters and statistics to better understand the health profile of medical students at Chika's University.

# Activity
Using the provided data, we are required to create Pivot Tables displaying the average values for various health metrics, as well as other relevant statistics, categorized by gender and medical conditions. Below are the necessary tasks we required to perform for this project:

1. Average Values for Male and Female Students:
   - Age: The average age for male and female students was calculated separately.

   - Average Height: The average height of male and female students (rounded to two decimal places).
   - Average Weight: The average weight of male and female students (rounded to two decimal places).

3. Number of Students across Different Blood Groups:
   - The distribution of students across various blood groups is presented, providing an overview of the blood group distribution within the cohort.
